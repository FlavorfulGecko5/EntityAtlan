Settings Explained:

input_folder: Path to your DOOM: The Dark Ages game installation
Example: input_folder = "C:/Steam/steamapps/common/DOOMTheDarkAges"

output_folder: Where to output extracted files
Must be < 16 characters long to prevent export failures due to long file paths
Example: output_folder = "D:/DA"

run_extractor: Set to 0 if you only want to run the deserializer

run_deserializer: Set to 0 if you only want to run the extractor

------

Advanced Extractor Settings:

resource_types: The types of resources that will be extracted.
All officially supported resource types are included by default.

You can exclude any type by commenting it out like this:
// rs_streamfile


WARNING: Adding resource types not officially supported by this extractor
may lead to undesired behavior! Do this at your own risk.

------

Deserializer Settings: These are primarily for debugging

deserialize_entity_defs: Set to 0 to skip deserializing entitydefs

deserialize_logic_decls: Set to 0 to skip deserializing logic decls

deserialize_level_files: Set to 0 to skip deserializing mapentities

remove_binary_files: Set to 0 to keep the raw binary files after deserializing them. This is useful for running the deserializer multiple times without needing to re-extract the files.

add_indentation: Does a second pass over the deserialized files to properly indent them. Requires rewriting the entire file. This will also validate the syntax.

include_originals: entitydefs and mapentities contain unserialized versions of the edit blocks, attached as strings to the end of the binary data. Setting this to 1 includes these strings in the output files. Editing these won't do anything, but it's useful for comparing the deserializer's output with id's original file. This will roughly double the size of extracted files.
